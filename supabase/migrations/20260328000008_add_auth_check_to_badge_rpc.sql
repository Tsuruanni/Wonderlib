-- Add auth.uid() verification to check_and_award_badges RPC.
-- Prevents a client from triggering badge awards for another user.
-- SECURITY DEFINER bypasses RLS, so we must verify identity explicitly.
-- Same pattern used in award_xp_transaction (20260328000004).
--
-- Note: This function is also called via PERFORM inside other
-- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (complete_vocabulary_session, etc.).
-- auth.uid() is session-wide so the check still passes correctly.
