I should launch the DHH Rails reviewer, Kieran Rails reviewer, and Code Simplicity reviewer agents to review the plan file.\n\nHowever, looking at this more carefully - this is a Flutter/Dart project, not a Rails project. The DHH Rails reviewer and Kieran Rails reviewer are specifically for Rails code. But the skill was invoked with these reviewers, so I should still try to use them - they may provide valuable architectural feedback even if the project isn't Rails.\n\nLet me launch all three agents in parallel to review the plan.\n</thinking>\n\nPlan'ı 3 farklı perspektiften inceliyorum."
